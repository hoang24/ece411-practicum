# PCB Design Review
We got feedback on our board layout from a few different teams as well as our TA Eric. We took into account many of the suggestions and implemented them before submitting our CAD file for printing.

# Recommendations and Suggestions:
* Include vias next to all the ground connections for your components.
* Check the ATMega chip output pins that are connected to your servo to ensure they are PWM capable.
* Label inputs and outputs on schematic

# Compliments:
* The layout looks very good.
* Appropriate use of 45-degree angle traces
* Appropriate trace widths
* Good use of vias
