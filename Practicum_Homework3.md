### Security Locker for Keys/Important Documents


**Executive Summary / Concepts of Operations**

A wall-mounted lockbox that can be used to store important documents, keys or other personal effects to provide 
extra security and ease of access. With this product, people can have more space to store important things, but it is
not occupy a lot of spaces. Everyone can easily use the wall-mounted clock to store documents, keys inside the box by entering

the place for the box.
The competition is all security boxes in the market. Two reasons make our security locker different from other security boxes

A wall-mounted lockbox should hold about 5 kilograms. When people enter Pin/Password or FingerPrint the door should open/close
within 10 seconds. Also, people can easily change Pin/Password by just entering old Pin/Password, press reset and enter new Pin/Password.
