Recommendations and Suggestions:
* Include vias next to all the ground connections for all your components.
* Check the ATMega chip output pins that are connected to your servo to ensure they are PWM capable.
* Label inputs and outputs on schematic

Compliments:
* The layout looks very good.
* Appropriate use of 45-degree angle traces
* Appropriate trace widths
* Good use of vias
